# Project: Day 3 - Escape_Alcatraz_Game
# Course: 100 Days of Python (Udemy)
# Author: Angel Santiago
# Date: 2 MAR 2025
# Objective: 
# - Practice working with if/elif/else statements.
# - Handle user input with input() function.
# - Use nested conditionals (if statements inside if statements).
# - Combine logic with string comparisons.
# - Build a simple text-based game using what weâ€™ve learned so far.

## How to Run
```bash
python escape_alcatraz_game.py

print(r'''
