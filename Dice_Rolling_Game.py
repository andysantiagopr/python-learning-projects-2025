# Learning Objectives:
# - Use lists to store and manage dynamic data.
# - Implement loops to automate repetitive actions (rolling dice).
# - Utilize functions for modular programming and reusability.
# - Modify list elements conditionally (changing 6 to 1 if total exceeds 12).
# - Use while loops to handle continuous user input and game progression.
# - Apply conditional statements to enforce game rules and determine win/loss conditions.
