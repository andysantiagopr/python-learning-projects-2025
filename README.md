# python-learning-projects-2025
Beginner and early-intermediate Python projects from my initial coding journey in 2025. Includes scripting, automation, and foundational exercises.

Projects were built to:
- Practice core Python concepts (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Develop simple scripts and automation tools
- Apply problem-solving skills in a real-world context

## üìÅ Included Projects

- `service-desk-bot`: A basic service desk automation script simulating help desk responses.
- `100-days-of-code-projects`: Exercises and mini-projects from the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Bootcamp" on Udemy.

## üìå Note

While I‚Äôm currently focused on JavaScript and full-stack development, these Python projects reflect my foundational learning and interest in scripting and automation.
