# üêç Python Learning Projects ‚Äì 2025

This repository contains a collection of beginner and early-intermediate Python projects I built during my initial coding journey in 2025.

These projects helped me develop a solid understanding of Python syntax, logic, and problem-solving. They range from small games and utilities to simple automation tools.

## ‚úÖ Purpose

These projects reflect my early dedication to mastering software development. While I am now focusing on **JavaScript** and **web development**, I keep this repo public to show my growth from the ground up and to document the fundamentals I learned through hands-on coding.

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Expand to web development (JavaScript, React, ServiceNow)
- Apply Python again in automation, scripting, and backend logic
- Build full-stack projects combining JS & Python knowledge
